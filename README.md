    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. 
    What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    The requirments of this ap was to be able to add and remove items from a
    database and assign a number for quantiy of that item. I also had to implment
    and sms message to warn when an item in the list was low and needed to be 
    restocked. The user needs for this app that were adressed were keeping track
    of stock in an application.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce 
    a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
    Why were your designs successful?
    
    I had to desgin four screens to create a user centered ui for this app to support the
    needs of the users. They were as follows a login in screen, grid view display of 
    inventory, setting and notification, and an add items. My ui desgins kept users in mind because 
    I kept it simple and didnt try to over whelm users with to much and I htink this is why it
    was successful.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or 
    strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    
    I approached coding this app by doing it in sections and testing when parts were finished.
    I also stepped away when needed or when I got stuck. I found that if I stepped away for alittle and 
    came back 10 or 15 minutes later it was better than if I continued to stare at the screen for 
    an hour and not getting anywhere. I plan to apply this in future school and professional work. 
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process 
    important and what did it reveal?
    
    I first tested my app myself by using the built in emualtor and then when I was comfortable with
    the app I had my wife and parents test it make sure other users could pick it up and be able to 
    use. I think this important because it is to be expected that I as the one who desgined should be able to
    use the app because I should know hoe it is suppose to work. But having other people expesically non technical 
    users test it allowed for me to see what issues they were having an actual allowed me to make some changes
    in the final submission that if I had not had them test it I would of missed. 
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial 
    planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a 
    challenge?
    
    The aspect I had the most issue was setting up the database to hold the names and the quantiy
    of the items. I was able to read through the text book and find good resouces online about 
    implenting the database and was able to over come the problem.
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly 
    successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    
    The component that i enjoyed learning the most an ffelt I did a good job
    demonstrating was the transition from screen to screen while using the app.
